The japicmp-gradle-plugin provides binary compatibility reporting through {japicmp-url}[JApicmp] using {gradle-url}[Gradle].

== Installation

Use the following snippet inside a Gradle build file:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'me.champeau.gradle:japicmp-gradle-plugin:0.1.1'
        // UNCOMMENT THE NEXT LINE ONLY IF YOU ARE USING GRADLE 1.X
        // classpath 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-backports-compat23:2.3.6'
    }
}
apply plugin: 'me.champeau.gradle.japicmp'
----

== Configuration

The plugin provides a new task type: `me.champeau.gradle.JapicmpTask` that you can use to compare two jars. This task
exposes the following properties as part of its configuration:

[horizontal]
oldArchive:: The jar file which will be used as the reference for comparison. Type: _File_.
newArchive:: The jar file we want the report to work on. Type: _File_.
onlyModified:: Outputs only modified classes/methods. If not set to true, all classes and methods are printed. Type: _boolean_. Default value: _false_
packagesToInclude:: List of package names to include, * can be used as wildcard. Type: _List<String>_
packagesToExclude:: List of package names to exclude, * can be used as wildcard. Type: _List<String>_
accessModifier:: Sets the access modifier level (public, package, protected, private). Type: _String_. Default value: _public_
failOnModification:: When set to true, the build fails in case a modification has been detected. Type: _boolean_. Default value: _false_
xmlOutputFile:: Path to the generated XML report. Type: _File_. Default value: _null_
htmlOutputFile:: Path to the generated HTML report (requires `xmlOutputFile` to be set). Type: _File_. Default value: _null_
txtOutputFile:: Path to the generated TXT report. Type: _File_. Default value: _null_

== Usage

Add the following to your build file:

[source,groovy]
----
task japicmp(type: me.champeau.gradle.JapicmpTask) {
    oldArchive = file('path/to/reference.jar')
    newArchive = jar.archivePath
    onlyModified = true
    failOnModification = true
    txtOutputFile = file("$buildDir/reports/japi.txt")
}
----

== Alternative task

An alternative task will let you work on dependencies instead of plain jars. Imagine that you want to compare the current
jar with a previous version, available in a repository. Then you can do:

[source,groovy]
----
task japicmp(type: me.champeau.gradle.ArtifactJapicmpTask) {
    baseline = 'com.acme.group:artifactid:version'
    to = jar.archivePath
    onlyModified = true
    failOnModification = true
    txtOutputFile = file("$buildDir/reports/japi.txt")
}
----

Note the use of `ArtifactJapicmpTask` instead of `JapicmpTask`.

== Custom build failure conditions

The plugin also supports a DSL providing hooks for classes and methods which have been added/removed/... You can use
those hooks to trigger custom build failures, like illustrated here:

[source,groovy]
----
task japicmp(type: me.champeau.gradle.ArtifactJapicmpTask) {
    baseline = 'com.acme.group:artifactid:version'
    to = jar.archivePath
    onlyModified = true
    failOnModification = false // by default, no failure
    txtOutputFile = file("$buildDir/reports/japi.txt")
    outputProcessor {
        removedMethod { clazz, method ->
            if (clazz.fullyQualifiedName == 'com.Foo') {
                failOnModification = true // This class must absolutely not be touched!
            }
        }
    }
}
----

The `outputProcessor` block supports the following hooks:

.Output processor hooks
[options="header,footer"]
|======================
|Hook name |Arguments |Description
|unchangedClass |JApiClass |Called on an unchanged class, unless onlyModified is true
|newClass |JApiClass |A class has been added
|modifiedClass |JApiClass |A class has been modified
|removedClass |JApiClass |A class has been removed
|unchangedMethod |(JApiMethod) or (JApiClass,JApiMethod) |Called on an unchanged method, unless onlyModified is true
|unchangedConstructor |(JApiConstructor) or (JApiClass,JApiConstructor) |Called on an unchanged constructor, unless onlyModified is true
|newMethod |(JApiMethod) or (JApiClass,JApiMethod) |A method has been added
|modifiedMethod |(JApiMethod) or (JApiClass,JApiMethod) |A method has been modified
|modifiedConstructor |(JApiConstructor) or (JApiClass,JApiConstructor) |A constructor has been modified
|removedMethod |(JApiMethod) or (JApiClass,JApiMethod) |A method has been removed
|removedConstructor |(JApiConstructor) or (JApiClass,JApiConstructor) |A method has been removed
|before |List<JApiClass> | Called before iteration on classes is triggered
|after |List<JApiClass> | Called after iteration on classes is triggered
|======================

The `xxxMethod` hooks support two variants. One takes a single argument corresponding to the method only. The second
version is a convenient way to track to which class the method belongs to, by adding it as a first argument.

== Custom output

The `outputProcessor` hooks can be used to produce custom reports, as illustrated here:

[source,groovy]
----
task japicmp(type: me.champeau.gradle.ArtifactJapicmpTask) {
    // ...

    outputProcessor {
        def sb = new StringBuilder()

        before {
            sb << "Comparing $baseline with $to\n"
        }
        after { list ->
            sb << "Reported ${list.size()} changed classes\n"
            file("${buildDir}/reports/custom.txt").write(sb.toString())
        }
        newMethod { c, m ->
           sb.append "Class $c.fullyQualifiedName has new method: $m.name\n"
        }
    }
}
